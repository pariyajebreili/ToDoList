-def str(self): 
 is a python method which is called when we use print/str to convert object into a string. 
 It is predefined , however can be customised.
'''
from django.db import models

class Person(models.Model):
    first_name = models.CharField(max_length=50)
    last_name = models.CharField(max_length=50)

    def __str__(self):
        return '%s %s' % (self.first_name, self.last_name)

-Meta inner class in Django models:
This is just a class container with some options (metadata) attached to the model. 
It defines such things as available permissions, associated database table name, whether the model is abstract or not, 
singular and plural versions of the name etc.

Ordering is basically used to change the order of your model fields.

'''
class student(models.Model):
  class Meta:
      ordering = [-1]
